Security HQ
===========

Centralised security information for AWS accounts.

Security HQ webapp
==================

This webapp presents the primary interface for Security HQ.

The `watched-account` CloudFormation template will create ConfigRules
that monitor the status of other AWS accounts. This application
presents the data collected by those processes.

It also provides an interface on some markers of a watched AWS
account's health from a security point of view.


## Deployment

The `bundle-hq.sh` script in this repository's TLD will generate an EBS
bundle. This can be run on the stack generated by the `security-hq`
CloudFormation template.

N.B. If you are using macOS you may need to install `coreutils` before you can run the build script:

1) get [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if you have not done so already

2) install coreutils using Homebrew `$ brew install coreutils`


## Development

### Getting started

### AWS Configuration

The security-test-user CloudFormation template should create a user with all the required permissions.

Once the CloudFormation is complete and the user created, you will need to create an access key for this user.

In the console, select the user and then under `security credentials` click `create access key`.

You will be presented with an *Access key ID* and a *Secret access key* that you are going to use during the next step.

Create the file `~/.aws/credentials` with the following contents

```
[security-test]
aws_access_key_id = <Access key ID>
aws_secret_access_key = <Secret Access key>
```

If you already had this file, you should just add this section.

Create the entry below in `~/.aws/config` file.

```
[profile security-test]
region = eu-west-1   
```

The next file is `~/.gu/security-hq.local.conf`, which should be given by one of your team members. Once you have it, make sure to update the value of key `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CERT_PATH`. 

Another file you need will need (here again ask for a team member) is `~/.gu/security-hq-service-account-cert.json`.

### AWS Security Policies
See `watched-account` template under `cloudformation` folder for the security policies needed to run security-hq.

### nginx setup

1. Install dev-nginx:

[dev-nginx](https://github.com/guardian/dev-nginx) contains a number of generic useful scripts to:
- issue certs locally (and automatically trust them)
- [generate an nginx config file](https://github.com/guardian/dev-nginx#setup-app) from a yaml definition

MacOS users:

```bash
brew tap guardian/homebrew-devtools
brew install guardian/devtools/dev-nginx
```

There are further instructions in the [dev-nginx](https://github.com/guardian/dev-nginx) repo.

2. configure dev-nginx:

run each of these commands:

`dev-nginx add-to-hosts-file`

`dev-nginx setup-cert security-hq.local.dev-gutools.co.uk`

`dev-nginx setup-app nginx/nginx-mapping.yml`

1. To stop and restart nginx you can now run:

`dev-nginx restart-nginx`

4. Now when you run the project (see next step for details), it will also be accessible via [https://security-hq.local.dev-gutools.co.uk/](https://security-hq.local.dev-gutools.co.uk/)

### Running project
From the root of the project:

1. Get Security Janus credentials. 

2. Run sbt: `$ ./sbt`

3. Select the project that you want to run: `sbt:security-hq> project hq`

4. Start the application: `sbt:security-hq> run`

Once the sever has started, the webapp is accessible at [https://security-hq.local.dev-gutools.co.uk/](https://security-hq.local.dev-gutools.co.uk/)

### Working with CSS and JS

Security HQ uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/about/) to provide opinionated code formatting and linting. As part of the automated build, all CSS and JS will be validated using the rules of Prettier and ESLint.

#### Testing changes, and passing code validation

Before beginning, you may want to install a node version manager, such as [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

1. You will need to install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) to handle the project dependencies:
	- Linux: Instructions can be found here: [https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#linux-tab](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#linux-tab)
	- Mac OSX: `$ brew install yarn`

2. Then install all the dependencies by running:

`$ yarn`


##### Running checks with Yarn

To see any errors and warnings for the CSS use:

`$ yarn run sass-lint`

To see any errors and warnings for the JS use:

`$ yarn run eslint`

To attempt to auto-fix the CSS and JS, you can try using Prettier:

`$ yarn run prettier`

**N.B. Although Prettier will write to the files, changes will still need to be staged afterwards.**


##### Checking CloudFormation

The aws cli can perform some basic template validation.

It requires AWS credentials to run, and can validate a single file like so:

`aws cloudformation validate-template --template-body file:///${PWD}/cloudformation/security-test-user.yaml --profile <AWS_PROFILE>`

[CFN nag](https://github.com/stelligent/cfn_nag) is a linting tool for CloudFormation templates that can help catch security issues.

If you have it installed, you can run:

`cfn_nag_scan --input-path cloudformation/*`
