Security HQ webapp
==================

This webapp presents the primary interface for Security HQ.

The `watched-account` ClouFormation template will create ConfigRules
that monitor the status of other AWS accounts. This application
presents the data collected by those processes.

It also provides an interface on some markers of a watched AWS
account's health from a security point of view.

## Deployment

The `bundle-hq.sh` script in this repository's TLD will generate an EBS
bundle. This can be run on the stack generated by the `security-hq`
CloudFormation template.

N.B. If you are using macOS you may need to install `coreutils` before you can run the build script:

1) get [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if you have not done so already

2) install coreutils using Homebrew `$ brew install coreutils`
